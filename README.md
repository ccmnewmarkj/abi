# Advertising Boost Initiative

In January 2020, the Center for Community Media at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY launched the (Advertising Boost Initiative)[https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/centers/center-community-media/advertising-boost-initiative/] to assist print and online outlets in New York City to become more effective in accessing their share of city agencies’ advertising budgets.

In the fiscal year after Mayor Bill de Blasio signed (Executive Order 47)[https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/260-19/mayor-de-blasio-signs-executive-order-ensure-information-city-services-reaches-all-new] mandating agencies to spend at least half of their advertising budgets on community media outlets, the city placed a record $9.9 million worth of advertising in the sector – or 84 percent of its total print and digital advertising budget. This crucial spending became a lifeline for many of the more than 230 community outlets serving city audiences in some 37 languages. In the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Census and the presidential and city elections, it kept essential community news sources afloat.

ABI Program Manager Darlie Gervais connected community publishers with city agency marketing directors, supported them with training and consultative resources, and kept them apprised of upcoming advertising campaigns, all while familiarizing city agency decision makers with the outlets they needed to know.

In December 2020, CCM published its independent (report)[http://abi.journalism.cuny.edu/] on EO 47 and ABI. The initiative offers a powerful model for how local governments can reinvest an existing budget line item toward local journalism.
